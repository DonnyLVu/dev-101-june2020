MadLib Challenge
===

Create a web page that allows the user to play a MadLib game!

## Choose a Laptop

Whoever has the birthday closest (in the year) to January 1st goes first. Do **not** do both people at the same time! Laptop owner does all the typing on that computer.

## Design MadLib

Come up with a short paragraph and pick some key words for which the user will provide values. You will need to know your sentence, where the words will be inserted, and part of speech for each word.

## Words

Provide labels and inputs for the user. Describe the grammar you want them to provide (noun, verb, adjective, etc). Keep in mind each input needs a unique `id`, so you might sequentially number them like `noun-1`, `noun-2`.

Time for a commit!

## Make MadLib

Provide a button for them to click when it is time to make the MadLib. When the user clicks the button, call your function and use string concatenation to make your completed MadLib. You can `console.log` the MadLib until you get to the next step.

## Show MadLib

Write the completed MadLib back to a paragraph tag in your html.

## Do It Again

Complete the process above on the other person's computer. Don't just look at the first person's completed code. Redo **your own thinking** about the problem.

## Add Some Style

Once both people have their working MadLib game, both of you can spend some time giving your individual page a creative style. Maybe find some fun images! Help each other out as need. 

Time for a commit!

## Show the World

Turn on GitHub pages so everyone can play your MadLib game!
