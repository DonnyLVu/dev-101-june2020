MadLib Challenge
===

Create a web page that allows the user to play a MadLib game!

## Duel Laptops

Work through the HTML and JavaScript simultaneously, then style independently

## Create Repo

Create and clone a new repo: `madlib-game`, then `cd` into it and open in VSCode!

## Design MadLib

Come up with a short paragraph and pick some key words for which the user will provide values. You will need to know your sentence, where the words will be inserted, and part of speech for each word.

## Words

Provide labels and inputs for the user. Describe the grammar you want them to provide (noun, verb, adjective, etc). Keep in mind each input needs a unique `id`, so you might sequentially number them like `noun-1`, `noun-2`.

Time for a commit!

## Make MadLib

Provide a button for them to click when it is time to make the MadLib. When the user clicks the button, call your function and use string concatenation to make your completed MadLib. You can `console.log` the MadLib until you get to the next step.  

Time for a commit!

## Show MadLib

Write the completed MadLib back to a paragraph tag in your html.

## Add Some Style

Once both people have their working MadLib game, both of you can spend some time giving your individual page a creative style. Maybe find some fun images! Help each other out as need.

## Show the World

Turn on GitHub pages so everyone can play your MadLib game!
