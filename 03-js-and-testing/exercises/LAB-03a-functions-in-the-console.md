## Functions in the Console

1) Make an index.html that points to a javascript file (app.js)
2) In this javascript file, make five objects that represent a kind of thing in real life (5 cat objects, 5 truck objects, 5 phone objects, 5 city objects, etc). Store these objects in different `const`s
3) Put all 5 objects in an array. Store this array in a `const`
4) Log this array out to the console.
5) Write a function that does two things:
    - logs out the words "Here are your 5 things!", using the array.length property to get the right number of things
    - logs this array out the the console
6) Call this function.
7) ACP
8) Deploy this page to github
STRETCH) Instead of using the array of things that is in global scope, re-write your function to take an array of things as an argument.
