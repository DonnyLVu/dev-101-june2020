## Functions in the Console

1) Make an index.html that points to a javascript file
2) In this javascript file, make five objects that represent a kind of thing in real life (5 cat objects, 5 truck objects, 5 phone objects, 5 city objects, etc). Store these objects in different `const`s
3) Put all 5 objects in an array. Store this array in a `const`
4) Log this array out to the console.
6) Write a function that does two things:
    - logs out the words "Here are your 5 things!", using the array.length property to get the right number of things
    - logs this array out the the console
5) Deploy this page to github
