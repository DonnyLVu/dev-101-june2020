# Math Functions with Tests

### Writing Code To Pass Tests

Today in lab you will fork and clone a GitHub repo, and then create solutions to some code problems such that your solutions pass the included tests.

### Forking the repo
Go to https://github.com/alchemycodelab/prep-math-functions and click on the `fork` button in the upper right. This will make a copy of this repo in your own account. Clone the _forked_ version of this repo locally by using `git clone url-of-my-forked-repo.git` in the terminal.

### Writing functions
In your cloned repo, in `math-functions.js`, you will find a place to write functions and instructions for how to write them. The first function `sum` is done for you.

### Tests
You are being given starter code for today, including tests. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in the `math-functions.test.js` file. You should
not change anything in the test files, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.

Make sure your PR passes travis!

## Checking Tests
Open `text/index.html` in live server. This will show you which tests are passing and which are still failing. Notice that `sum` is passing, because it is complete and correct in `math-functions.js`. For this lab, write your functions in `math-functions.js` while checking these.

## Committing 'when it works'
Every time you get a new test to pass, ACP with a concise but descriptive commit message.

## Submitting
Link to your forked repo with passing tests in travis.
